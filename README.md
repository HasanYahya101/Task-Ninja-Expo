# Task Ninja (React Native + Expo)

## Introduction

This is a Task Tracking app that is built for Android and IOS using React Native and Expo. It allows for adding lists and adding tasks to those lists. Moreover, it allows for marking tasks as done and deleting them. Tasks can also be edited and starred.

## UI Library

[React Native Reusables](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/react-native-reusables) is used as UI Library for tgis application. Moreover, `react-native-reanimated` is also used in it as an animation library.

## Deployment

The APK for Android has been built using `eas-cli` and is available for download in the Releases section. While this app works completly fine for IOS as well, creating an app requires Apple Devalopers account (which reqires extra money). So, you can use it on IOS using a mac in `dev` mode. However, i have no plans to release an app on IOS.

## Other Dependencies

`pnpm` is used to download the dependencies. Just use the `pnpm i` command to get a `node_modules` folder. Then use `npx expo` command to run the app and use `Expo Go` app on Android and IOS to preview it and build it (with hot-reloading).
